Recently many friends asked me about what happened to my house. Here is my story:

1.	in 2016, most of my family went to China. Only I would stay in US. I decided to move to a smaller apartment, closer to my office, while rented this house out. Since my kids would come back in Semptember 2017, I made the lease end in August 2017.

2.	In March 2016, I found current tenant -- Wang, Jing and Zou, Jiasen. They said they would use it as daycare. I said I'm OK with it as long as they make it completely legal. Also, since I don't want to find a place to put my belongings, I asked to keep my belonging in the house. The tenants can use them if needed. But they must keep them with care because I would still need them after the lease ended. They agreed. We put those agreement into the old lease.

3.	 In January 2017, the tenant asked if they could renew the lease because the paperworks to operate a daycare were very complicate and fixed to specific address. They begged me by saying the business is so important to their family. They would like to increase the rent as high as $4000 a month. At first I refused because I would move back with my family and the said money far not enough to compensate my trouble and inconvinience. But later my wife (she can't be back to US because of some immigration issues) told me trying to help others as long as we could. I listened to her and offer them a fair discount price of $3600 a month, about the same amount that I need to pay my bank loan and real property tax, if they agree not to bother me with small repair and maintenance and all my belonging still stay in the house unless I would take away. And I would find another place for my family. They agreed and expressed the appreciation.

4.	In May 2017, the building department of North Hempstead gave me a notice on multiple violations: 1. no rental permit applied. 2. No change to daycare filed. 3. No permit for the outdoor sign for the daycare 4. Some structure (bathroom in the basement, front yard pavement, roof over front terrace) not compatible with historical record. 5. need drawing of the smoke detector locations for the daycare. I went to the building department and got the forms to fill. Since I'm not living in the area, I asked the tenants if they are willing to communicate with the building department and take care of those small issues such as drawing and detectors, and the issues due to their daycare (2 and 5), and I will take care of my part. They agreed. They helped me to send the forms and I paid the application fee for the rental permit.

5.	In June 2017, they asked me if we could sign the new lease so that their daughter can continue to the school in that disctrict. I agreed and signed the new lease

6.	After the lease was signed, they changed their attitude. No more apprecation. Instead, they blamed me for not address those violations myself. They stopped paying me the rental from August. They didn't pay anything for the new lease, neither the rental or the security deposit.  They said they won't pay me anything until the violation get cleared. They changed the access code of the door to the house and refused to tell me the code. They even refused to give me my microwave and vacuum after I moved to the new place I rented in the area, which is supposed to help them to continue living in my own house and continue their business. To keep those devices, they disallow the workers I hired to enter the house while I was also in. They demanded I first enter and marked those to move, and the works moved them out after I walked out. At first the male tenant was still a little shamed on what they did and asked me privately if he could keep the microwave by offering me $100 without letting his wife know. But 20 minutes later he regretted and question me "I already allow you to take your bed, how can you still want your microwave?" Because of such difficullties, I didn't move all my belongs later turned to be needed at that moving day. And they refused me to get them any more, including some electronics, winter clothes of my parents, toys and book of my kids. I called the police and I was told they could not help unless I got warranty from court. 

7.	What happened makes me very frustrated. I no more believe they are the people worth the help from me. I want them to leave. I hired a lawyer to defend my interest. Now everything are in the pipeline of eviction.

8.  So I started the lawsuit. Soon I found it is not easy as I thought. They use all the ways to avoid trial.

    2017/9/11 I found an attorney specialized in tenant/landlord issue. We signed the attainment and made the demand letter.
  
    2017/9/19 The demand letter was deliverred.
  
    2017/9/29 We get the hearing date
  
    2017/10/17 The hearing was adjouned to 10/30 upon the tenants' motion
  The tenants tried to settle by asking for vacacy at end of June 2018. Rejected
  
    2017/10/30 The tenant's attorney found the demand letter asking for 3 days response time while the new lease specify 5 days.
  
    2017/11/16 The court dismissed the case and we had to start over
  
    2017/12/26 The hearing was adjouned again upon the tenants' motion
  
    2018/1/11 The tenants tried to settle by asking for vacacy at end of Feb 2018. Rejected. 
  The trial was scheduld to 2/15. But I already book flight to reunion with my family for the Chinese New Year. So we have to adjoun to 3/19
  
    2018/3/19 In the court they requested adjourn again because they need a Chinese intepreter but they didn't request so ahead of time so there is no intepreter available that day. The judge order them to move out by 4/30 and the unpaid arrears would be decided on the next trial date 5/2.
  
9.	All the above have evidences to support.

As you can imagine, I'm very frustrated. Not only I lost tens thousands of dollars and hundred of hours, but also I feel my kindness was abused and exploited. Thanks god they finally would get out of my house. Hopefully my painful story can give you a headsup: stay away from rogues.
